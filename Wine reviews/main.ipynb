       "         b'Aromas of exotic spice, prune, resin and nail polish remover lead the nose. The big, round palate delivers raisin, fig, licorice, ground pepper and a confectionary note alongside a network of polished, velvety tannins. Drink through 2026.',\n",
       "         b\"Light brown and slightly translucent in color. Aromas lean toward raisin and prune, but there's orange zest and molasses on the bouquet as well. Bores straight ahead on the palate, with sweet flavors of burnt brown sugar, caramel and prune. Satisfying and balanced even if it's not overly complex.\",\n",
       "         b\"This Amarone has nearly overripe aromas, with hints of nail varnish and raisin. The palate is better, offering spirit-soaked black cherry, black pepper and licorice notes. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate.\",\n",
       "         b'This is a remarkable effort at the price, the wine sourced from Beckstoffer-owned sites in Carneros. Apple, peach and lemon highlight an integrated, vibrantly fresh experience on the palate, which lingers and impresses long after the finish.',\n",
       "         b'With a nose of toffee, dried apricot, cocoa powder and rancio, this is classic off-dry amontillado. It feels fresh and active, then tastes rich and moderately sweet, with flavors of hazelnut, caramel, toasted banana, orange and spice. Nutty and smooth on the finish.',\n",
       "         b\"This unoaked Chardonnay is so ripe and rich, you won't miss the buttered-toast flavor of oak. It's incredibly potent with limes, mangoes, oranges and pineapples, uplifted with brisk acidity. A weekend brunch of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon will be the perfect occasion.\",\n",
       "         b'The blend in 2006 is 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Syrah, 10% Petit Verdot and 9% Cabernet Franc. It spent 30 months in 90% new oak. Released a year ago, it has a feminine grace and softness in the aromas, a lovely mix of flowers and spice. The Syrah brightens up the fruit, accenting berry flavors with a hint of pepper, while the Petit Verdot adds clover and violet aromas and density to the tannins.',\n",
       "         b'The expected cut-grass greenness shows on the nose of this wine, but so do plenty of white flowers, nectarine, golden apples and chalk. The palate is rather rich in style for this grape, perhaps explained by its slight aging, but well done with ripe apple flesh and more cut-grass flavors.',\n",
       "         b'Generic red-fruit aromas set up a solid palate. This tastes of roasted plum and berry fruits, while a straightforward finish is grabby in feel and tastes the slightest bit herbal and green.',\n",
       "         b'Blatant green aromas of bell pepper and thyme are the dominant aromas. A raw, tannic, edgy mouthfeel and herbal, green flavors are patently Chilean and compounded by this cool vintage. Mint and leftover green flavors take up space on a bullish, tannic finish.',\n",
       "         b'This wine, with its massive tannins and rich fruit, is obviously set for a long life. It does have the contrast of fresh black-currant acidity to give it a lift. But with the power behind it, the wine will develop slowly. Drink from 2025.',\n",
       "         b'Lighter in color and density, this wine shows smoked berries, rust and iodine on the nose. The palate is decorated with black olives, smoked cherries and more sanguine elements.',\n",
       "         b\"Reduced aromas provide significant distraction at the outset, with floral and tropical notes fighting to get to the surface. The palate doesn't entirely stay together, as if the wine can't make up its mind which way it wants to go. White grapefruit flavors come through on the finish.\",\n",
       "         b\"Rare to find on its own, as it's mainly used in sparkling-wine blends, this Pinot Meunier is earthy in dark truffle and herb, more savory, dry flavors that are wrapped in tightly woven tannins and oak. The muted fruit that's there recalls sweet raspberry.\",\n",
       "         b'Sweet and simple, with pleasant peach, apple and spice notes. Fresh and clean on    the finish.',\n",
       "         b'This wine has an earthy character, with some bitter flavors as well as more generous acidity and yellow fruits, The earthiness should blow off as it develops to give a ripe, richly fruity wine.',\n",
       "         b\"A thin wine, this has light blackberry fruit, and while it's nicely dry, the tannins are strong and sticky, and the alcohol is very high, lending a slight burn to the palate.\",\n",
       "         b\"Light wood aging gives this wine a very smooth character. It's acidity and varietal character are subsumed into an almost Chardonnay richness and weight. The balance and the ripe flavors are impressive, while the final taste does bring out the pepper character of the grape.\",\n",
       "         b\"This well priced wine offers typical Shiraz aromas and flavors, ranging from cherries to black olives and weaving in some smoky and tarry accents. It's medium-bodied, with a plump feel but also a firmly tannic backbone that would serve it well alongside steak, chops or burgers.\",\n",
       "         b\"Despite the reserve designation, this is a forward, fruity, quaffable red blend of Merlot, Cabernet, Syrah and Cabernet Franc. There's plenty of toast and spice up front, along with somewhat chalky, chocolatey tannins. The finish fades quickly.\",\n",
       "         b\"The bringing together of Malbec and Tempranillo works like a charm here. There's a touch of complexity to the fruit-forward nose, and better depth than what most under-$10 red varietals offer. Look for sweet, smooth raspberry and plum flavors with a tasty, balanced finish.\",\n",
       "         b\"Dry and rich, with bracing acids and minerals, this has complex pineapple, pear and buttercream flavors. It's lovely to drink now.\",\n",
       "         b'Sweet strawberry and red-melon fruits show on the nose of this bottling along with clove, star anise and a touch of herbs. The boysenberry flavors on the sip are laid across fine-grained tannins and a decent acidity.',\n",
       "         b'This is a balanced and complex fifty-fifty blend, with herbal accents of licorice root, coffee bean and foliage that mingle harmoniously with ripe fruit notes of blackberry, wild raspberry and cherry. Medium weight and lushly textured, but not overdone, with a long finish that delivers light hints of mocha and pepper.',\n",
       "         b\"This lovely blend of Sauvignon Blanc, and 14% Roussanne, is as crisp and fresh as its name implies. Bright fruit flavors of lemon, lime, orange and pineapple speak to the success of this unusual blend. It's a bracing, palate-cleansing white wine that will be appealing all year round.\",\n",
       "         b\"D'Amare is a rich blend of Chardonnay and Viognier, offering a thick, viscous mouthfeel and bright notes of apricot, pear, pineapple and exotic fruit. It shows fine density and a creamy finish.\",\n",
       "         b\"Concentrated and rich, with some wood influence, this has ripe yellow fruits that are balanced with an intense streak of acidity, lending a sense of tension. It's very full, round and already a delight to drink.\",\n",
       "         b'This is dark and brooding, showing earthy aromas of tilled earth, leather and farmyard. The palate is big and ripe, with black fruit, nutmeg and white pepper flavors.',\n",
       "         b\"There are brambly, wild cherry aromas and flavors in this wine, as well as a little cocoa, but this Sierra Foothills Zin is still fairly tight and hard to tell which direction it will go from here. A majority (80%) Zin, there's also 20% Syrah that was cofermented with Viognier in the blend.\",\n",
       "         b'The bouquet on this Malbec is just right; it shows integrated aromas of smoke, cola, blackberry, cherry and brown sugar. The palate offers strong acidity, which keeps the wine racy. Black-fruit flavors dry up on the finish, which is a bit acidic. This is very good but lacks complexity.',\n",
       "         b\"Food friendly and simple, this possesses a uniquely firm structure, with tonic perlage and spicy notes of white pepper and field flower. It's bright, fresh and very dry on the close.\",\n",
       "         b'Big, dark tannins dominate this concentrated wine that is powerful, dry and firm. Under the structure lies a smoother layer of ripe plum and berry fruits. At 90% Malbec and 10% Merlot, it will certainly need more time to mature; drink from 2018.',\n",
       "         b\"This blend of 70% Montepulciano and 30% Sangiovese opens with aromas of prune and mocha that carry over to the palate. It lacks fruit richness and freshness and it's easy to detect evident alcohol.\",\n",
       "         b\"A unique blend of Syrah (78%), Cabernet Sauvignon (13%) and Mourv\\xc3\\xa8dre, this low-alcohol wine (for the vintage and region) offers aromas of high-toned dried herbs, earth, smoked meat, smoke and white pepper. The citrusy fire-pit flavors are elegant and show persistence. It's a unique expression of the area that should do well on the dinner table.\",\n",
       "         b'Match stick and oily white-fruit aromas come in front of a round, somewhat fat palate with warm, oily flavors of lychee, banana and spice. This falls off toward ripe banana and blandness on the finish.',\n",
       "         b\"Ample vanilla notes from oak aging mark the nose and palate of this savory Shiraz. It's on the full side for the Hunter, with a rich texture and a long, velvety finish. Drink 2015\\xe2\\x80\\x932025.\",\n",
       "         b'90-92 Barrel sample. Great density here, this wine is big and powerful, but all held together by rich fruit. It is concentrated, the dry tannins a part of a richer whole.',\n",
       "         b'It is the tart-ripe contrast of tangerine and ripe lemon that makes both nose and palate so enticing. The purity of flavors and this appealing contrast carry right through on the taut, bright, linear and dry palate. Its texture seems stony and profound. What stays and charms is the purity of that Amalfi lemon finish. This is so beautiful and very, very lasting. Drink 2020\\xe2\\x80\\x932035.',\n",
       "         b\"Young and tight, this requires aggressive aeration before it begins to show much flavor. It's worth the effort, as it evolves into a dense, delicious wine that marries its juicy stone fruits to a rich mix of vanilla, coconut and caramel components from the barrel aging. Drink 2018 to 2030.\",\n",
       "         b'Fresh red cherry and plump red currants are spiced up by Dr Pepper, cola, rose petals, mace and dried fennel on the nose of this bottling by Sabrine Rodems. Tea and Asian five-spice notes arise once sipped, backed by raspberries and pink peppercorns, altogether fairly light and lithe in body.',\n",
       "         b'This wine from longtime Bonny Doon associate Nicole Walsh starts off with strong aromas of rhubarb and rose petals. Flavors trend toward savory elements, with upturned earth, pine tar and mushrooms surround by soft tannins that coat the mouth.',\n",
       "         b'Floral red-fruit aromas are slightly medicinal and suggestive of cherry cough drop. A healthy, chewy mouthfeel and flavors of plum and raspberry end with textural solidity and modest refinement. This is an interesting mix of 55% Petit Verdot with Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc, and a dash of Malbec.',\n",
       "         b\"Dry and short on fruit, with strong barrel aromas of pepper, cinnamon and resin. In the mouth, there's more wood than fruit, leaving heat, vanilla and spice to overshadow mild strawberry/raspberry flavors. What's best about the wine is the mouthfeel; it's round and creamy, with length. Anyone averse to forward oak should steer clear of Utop\\xc3\\xada.\",\n",
       "         b'Attractive aromas that suggest apple, tropical fruit and citrus lift from the glass while the vibrant, elegant palate delivers Bosc pear and mineral. Crisp acidity lifts the silky flavors.',\n",
       "         b'This was aged but three months in oak, but it smells and tastes woody. Char, resin and toasty blackberry and black plum aromas lead into a resiny palate with charred flavors of black cherry and plum. Burnt, bitter notes rise up on the finish.',\n",
       "         b'Brings a welcome restraint to Cabernet, offering a dry, somewhat tannic wine of great elegance. Easy to like for its balanced flavors of blackberries and black currants, with gentle influences of oak. Pretty good price for a wine of polish and sophistication.',\n",
       "         b'The bouquet on this blend from the Limar\\xc3\\xad region is perfumed, floral and slightly exotic, with spunky red-fruit scents and graphite. The palate is full and mouthfilling, with lightly herbal blackberry, plum, pepper and spice flavors along with mild heat and a toasted note. Despite showing a hint of burn, this is a serious wine with short-term aging potential. Drink now\\xe2\\x80\\x932017.',\n",
       "         b'Fermented in stainless steel, this is a lip-smacking wine with succulent citrus flavors of lemon and grapefruit. For those who love high-acid white wines, with some snap to their flavors, this is a good choice.',\n",
       "         b\"Hints of sugar cookie and tangerine entice on the nose of this bold, bang-for-your-buck Gew\\xc3\\xbcrztraminer. Off dry and voluminous in style, it's full of rich, penetrating grapefruit flavor edged with bitter lime pith. The finish is long and sleek.\",\n",
       "         b\"Deep blueberry and blackcurrant aromas waft off this bottling, as do scents of oak smoke and beef char. It's thick in the glass, with sticky tannins and strong acidity that present flavors of boisterous blackberry, tar, pepper, dark chocolate and dried herbs.\",\n",
       "         b'Rubbery stewy berry aromas give way to a pinched-feeling palate. This tastes of salty roasted plum and it stays that way on a dense, chewy, meaty finish.',\n",
       "         b\"Spicy, stalky, roasted plum and berry aromas are savory and earthy. In terms of feel, this is big but has its shirt tucked in. The flavors, however, are herbal and almost weedy. This gets more difficult the longer it sits; by the time it finishes it's outright funky, herbal, medicinal and earthy all wrapped into one.\",\n",
       "         b'An earthy, funky block-designated wine, this tastes thin despite its fuller-bodied alcohol level. A plethora of fresh-picked herb and forest characterizes this effort, which finishes in thick tannin.',\n",
       "         b'Just off-dry, this is a smooth, caramel and red fruit flavored wine. It has plenty of acidity to balance its soft texture, with red currant freshness coming in at the end. Drink now.',\n",
       "         b'Made from 50% Merlot with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, this reserve-level wine is thick in herb, cedar and pencil lead, classical in some ways, thick in chewy tannins otherwise. It finishes in a swirl of chocolate and caramel.',\n",
       "         b'A fine, ripe wine\\xe2\\x80\\x94very balanced\\xe2\\x80\\x94from an estate that dates back to the 12th century. The Tannat grape lends tannins but also offers ripe, juicy fruits that come forward to give both power and delicious fruitiness.',\n",
       "         b'This is very flavorful, fruity and full bodied. It maintains a sleek texture in spite of considerable tannins that keep it feeling dry. Aromas are like wild berries and cherry blossoms, the flavors are exotic and very ripe, and the finish keeps adding more fruit nuances.',\n",
       "         b'Fine fruits, red-berry flavors and crisp acidity give this wine a fine balance and immediate attraction. It is lively with its bright texture and finishing acidity. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       "         b'This wine is a blend of Merlot (37%), Cabernet Franc (31%), Cabernet Sauvignon (19%) and a whopping 13% Petit Verdot. Aromas of flowers, scorched earth, green herb and red fruit lead to concentrated, quite pure fruit and earth flavors. It brings a lovely sense of texture and the tannins add some heft.',\n",
       "         b'The bouquet offers a wide array of aromatic details that still need time to integrate. Notes of spice, black fruit, cola, ginger, licorice and sweet chewing tobacco are all recognizable. A pungent note of dried apple skin makes for a lively finish.',\n",
       "         b'Fragrant and polished, this offers enticing aromas of spiced plum, rose, aromatic herb and menthol. The elegant, linear palate doles out red cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, pipe tobacco and mineral set against firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018 through 2028.',\n",
       "         b'Made with 95% Sangiovese and 5% Syrah, this easygoing red opens with aromas that recall red berry, dark spice and blue flower. The fresh palate offers juicy strawberry, cinnamon and a white pepper note alongside bright acidity and silky tannins.',\n",

It's big but balanced on the sip, where powerful acidity provides ballast to the ripe fruit. Tangy cranberry and plum-skin flavors are cut by graphite minerality.\",\n",
       "         b'A blend of Encruzado and Gouveio, this is a soft, creamy and fruity wine. It has no wood aging, emphasizing the ripe apricot and pear fruits. The aftertaste is crisp and bright.',\n",
       "         b'Ripe apple fruit is tempered by citrus freshness tinged with herbal spice suggesting sage and fennel seed. In the end, citric purity wins and carries this streamlined, concentrated wine into a long, spicy finish.',\n",

Impressive and classy from this Lake County winery.\",\n",

       "         b'Gorgeously pure apple, both fresh and baked, immediately appears on the nose. Evolution is in progress here, slowly transforming fresh fruit notes into richer flavors.

       "         b\"Strong and ripe and oaky. Not showing much subtlety, but a very good example of the modern California style. It's a clean, vibrant Chardonnay starring massive flavors of pineapple tart, Meyer lemon custard and tangerines, brightened with zesty acidity.\",\n",

       "         b\"Minty, leathery berry fruit aromas are herbal and foresty. This is flush and solid in feel, with controlled tannins. Roasted, herbal black plum and berry flavors are what you'd expect from Colchagua Valley Carmen\\xc3\\xa8re, while this feels meaty and tastes blackened on the finish.\",\n",
       "         b'A luscious and elegant nose promises richness, and the flavors deliver even more than expected. The backbone of zingy acidity finds a perfect match with flavors of white peach, lime, and poached pear. Coming from a 35-year-old, 2,000-foot-high vineyard at the northeast of the Santa Cruz Mountains, this memorable wine that can tackle herb-crusted pork chops as easily as salmon, shellfish or soft cheeses.',\n",

       "         b'Bell pepper and sharp red fruit aromas provide a shaky start, which is followed by cranberry, tart cherry and other pointed flavors. The feel is racy and tight, with gritty acids. Airing does improve it somewhat. Tasted twice; this is a review of the better bottle. Cabernet, Merlot, Cab Franc and Carmen\\xc3\\xa8re is the blend. From Brazil.',\n",
       "         b'Floral aromas of blue flower and bright berry take center stage in this pretty blend of 85% Montepulciano and 15% Syrah. The palate delivers juicy raspberry and cherry flavors, alongside soft, supple tannins. This is round and extremely accessible now so enjoy soon.',\n",

       "         b'Lemelson makes a consistent lineup of single vineyard Pinots, and with a track record extending back a decade or more, the results are predictably satisfying. The Meyer has a solid core of blackberry and black cherry, highlighted with a lining of licorice, scents of dried herb and citrusy acids. Beautifully styled and riding on perfectly ripened fruit, it will be hard to keep your hands off it, but it can cellar for 5\\xe2\\x80\\x936 more years.',\n",
       "         b\"Ripe enough in raspberry, cherry and mulberry fruit, with some flashy notes, but it's all sweet, upfront flavor, with not much else going on. The acidity is fine and the tannins are pretty, but this ultimately is a fairly simple, jammy wine.\",\n",

       "         b'This outstanding value is sharp and precise, its black-cherry fruit holding down a compact core, annotated with streaks of coffee, truffle and chocolate. It punches well above its price, and should drink nicely into the early 2020s.',\n",
       "         b'Cherry and berry aromas are standard and good. Feels a bit edgy and clipped, with slightly herbal red plum flavors accented by a lot of oak and pepper. Turns real spicy and hot on the finish.',\n",
       "         b\"You'll have to go far and wide to find a bigger, richer California Chardonnay. It's enormous, offering an explosion of tropical fruit, citrus and apricot, brightened by crisp acidity. Despite the power, the wine maintains elegance and balance. This is one of the few Chards that will take bottle age, gradually losing fruit. Drink now\\xe2\\x80\\x932018.\",\n",

       "         b'This barrel fermented wine is full-bodied and rich with ripe yellow fruit and spicy toast notes. The wine has a fine tangy edge that gives it a real lift and contrasts with the dense, vanilla and fruit finish. Drink now.',\n",
       "         b'Smoky, spicy aromas are highly wood-driven, which creates hickory and campfire scents rather than discernible fruit. This feels a touch sticky and soupy, while baked, woody berry, black plum and cassis flavors are charred prior to a spicy, chunky finish.',\n",
       "         b'Subtle fruit and baking spice aromas lead to expansive peach, pear and fig flavors riding on a wave of fresh, crisp acidity that keeps this lively through the finish, even though the texture is quite lush and creamy. The wine is almost a meal in itself, but will make a grand pairing with rich seafood dishes or even a cheese course. Delicious now through at least 2018.',\n",
       "         b\"What a pleasant surprise awaits you here: It's delectable, decadent and downright delicious. Fabulous mango, lime, and peach aromas parade upward in advance of vivid nectarine and pink grapefruit flavors. This charmer, which features perfect vitality and acidity, is almost too easy to drink and enjoy.\",\n",
       "         b\"Darker in color than many other versions of the variety, this bottling shows hearty charred meat, blackberry, gravel and condensed rose petal aromas. There's a leathery structure to the palate, where peppercorn, tobacco and red fruit notes lead into a mocha-laced finish.While it lacks the typical Cabernet Franc freshness, it has plenty of depth.\",\n",
       "         b\"There's not much going on here beyond lots of smoky, caramelized oak and some easy peach and citrus flavors. A touch of unripeness is also found. Chardonnnay has not been ZD's strong suit, and still isn't.\",\n",
       "         b'Tart cherry aromas and flavors with tarragon accents are wrapped in oak in this medium-weight, mature red. The wine is evenly textured, but the oak sits well to the fore, really predominating on the very dry, tangy-in-a-woody-way finish. \\xe2\\x80\\x94M.M.',\n",

       "         b'This ambitious, against-all-odds island project with ancient grapevines is showing promising results, in this case offering smoked meats, hard spice and very tight purple fruit on the nose. The palate is tart with cranberries and raspberries, with a pencil lead and earth character, proving quite interesting if not entirely Zin-like.',\n",

       "         b'Aged 22 months in 35% new French oak, this semisweet wine is so rich and luscious it could be poured at the end of a meal to pair with chocolate or chunks of salty pecorino. It smells like strawberries and black cherries, tastes ripe and jammy and has a soft, mouth-filling texture and low acidity.',\n",
       "         b\"Half barrel-fermented and half done in stainless steel, this classy effort seems to overdeliver. It starts with good fruit, but the feeling is that winemaker Jessica Munnell did everything right, and maxxed out the complexity. It's a sensuous mix of grape and barrel, steel and butterscotch, with a lively, lingering finish.\",\n",

The palate follows suit, with mouthfilling flavors of ripe berries that are framed by structured tannins and lingering tones of licorice and black pepper.',\n",

       "         b'Fleshy peach, spice and citrus lead on this fresh, fun white from Cyprus, which displays good balance of refreshing summer fruit and minerals with an underpinning of honeyed softness. Versatile and easygoing, this will pair well with grilled fish and poultry.',\n",
       "         b\"Dank earth, dark berry and cherry are the standouts in this wine, which is a bit more lush than some of the producer's vineyard-designates. Approachable in its acidity and oak, it's a good place to start at a somewhat reasonable entry price.\",\n",
       "         b'Made with Moscato, this sparkling dessert wine opens with aromas of fragrant white flower, apricot and a note of chopped herb. The foaming palate offers dried apricot, yellow peach and candied nectarine zest while a lemon drop note signals the close.',\n",

       "         b'Abeja winemaker John Abbott sources fruit for this 100% Merlot from the estate (Heather Hill) vineyard and old-vine Bacchus grapes.

       "         b'The lifted nose promises purity, which the palate follows thorough on, with the gentle fruit of ripe pear and mirabelle plum and the softer freshness of ripe lemon. There is just a smattering of white pepper. All is held with great poise and freshness, and there is something utterly clean and pure about this.',\n",
       "         b'Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah, with slightly more of the former. It hinges on large swathes of barbecue smokiness and heaping grilled meat, with a baseline of licorice and vanilla-laced tannin that can sometimes overwhelm.',\n",
       "         b'This producer, based in the Tarn valley east of Cahors, has created a rounded, ripe and fruity wine. With some young tannins still in evidence, it is all about berry fruits and balanced acidity. The structure will soften over the next few months, so drink this attractively fruity wine from late 2017.',\n",
       "         b'Basic raspberry and plum aromas and flavors are accented by herbal, foresty notes. The palate is grabby, tannic and chunky, with herbal accents to the berry fruit flavors. Finishes with milk chocolate, acidity and tannic bite.',\n",

       "         b'The merest touch of apricot caresses the vanilla and hazelnut notes of fine oak. The palate, on the other hand, conveys power and concentration, held tight and taut by lemon freshness.

       "         b'Rubbery earthy aromas include black-fruit scents and a touch of prune. This Menc\\xc3\\xada feels raw, drawing and pinched. Overt oak notes share the flavor profile with tart plum and currant, while the finish is abrupt.',\n",
       "         b'Initially this is minerally on the nose but not overly fruity, with notes of grass and green bean. The palate is fairly crisp despite being round and mouthfilling. Flavors of papaya, grapefruit and green banana finish with controlled pithy bitterness.',\n",
       "         b'Loamy, ripe aromas of raisin and prune are neither exact nor direct. This has a heavy, tannic mouthfeel with balance issues. Rubbery plum and prune flavors finish with a soft, spread-out feel.',\n",

       "         b'Light and luminous in appearance, this bright Rosso di Montalcino delivers subdued aromas of raspberry, cherry, cola and wet earth. None of these aromas are particularly intense, but they are balanced.',\n",
       "         b'This is a serious wine, despite the ripe fruitiness on its surface. It is full of peach and mango flavors, but structured by a cool, mineral feel. Tangy acidity and tight texture adds tension. It still needs to age 2\\xe2\\x80\\x934 years. Screwcap.',\n",

The creamy, expressive palate doles out juicy apricot, lemon drop and sage while bright acidity and a frothy mousse lift the finish. There's a lot to like here.\",\n",
       "         b'Striking acidity adds freshness to more rustic characteristics of cooked red fruit, caramelized sugar and hay on this medium-bodied Pinot. Brambly on the palate with hints of mushroom and foliage, it finishes clean with just a trace of tannins.',\n",
       "         b'Very delicious and luscious, but no mere fruit bomb. It has the tannic-acidic structure and dryness to make it refined, but explodes on the palate with blackberry, chocolate, cassis, anise and sweet, smoky cedar flavors that are deep and long. Tastes important and first rate.',\n",
       "         b'This eight-year old wine, based on Touriga Nacional, is ripe, now mature with the tannins fully integrated into the rich black fruit. It is firm with a structure that gives concentration and perfumed acidity. The wine is still dark and dense although ready to drink.',\n",
       "         b\"Here's a pretty and bright Pinot Grigio with sensations of green apple and pear. This is simple but well made, and while it makes a refreshing ap\\xc3\\xa9ritif, it will also pair nicely with pasta al pomodoro or lightly seasoned fish dishes.\",\n",
       "         b\"This robust red opens with scorched earth, new leather, underbrush and dark spice aromas. The palate is brawny and monolithic, offering licorice, dried cherry and clove flavors with the warmth of evident alcohol. It's framed by chewy tannins and should be drunk soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.\",\n",
       "         b\"This elegant and savory Nero d'Avola offers cassis, blue flower and baking spice aromas. It's a full-bodied expression of the grape, boasting ripe black cherry, blackberry and black pepper hints alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2021.\",\n",
       "         b'A Clarksburg Chenin that does its region proud, this is invitingly floral, with a thick, viscous imprint of pear and fig and just slightly sweet at 1.1% residual sugar.',\n",
       "         b'The Sonoma Zinfandel house pursues a rich, opulent Rh\\xc3\\xb4ne style in this bottling, with aromas of dark red fruit, purple florals, game and wet asphalt. It hits the palate with a Sichuan pepper-like buzz that enlivens the mouth far into the finish, with well-seasoned flavors of dried cherries, fennel and crushed Italian herbs.',\n",
       "         b'This Sauvignon opens with beautiful aromas of exotic fruit, citrus, dried sage and a touch of cinnamon spice at the back. The mouthfeel is smooth and dense with a crisp, but creamy aftertaste.',\n",
       "         b\"This is a lovely wine to drink now. It's so dry and elegantly constructed, with wonderfully ripe tannins and great integration of oak with the fruit. There's a nice balance of acidity to balance the blackberry, cherry and cola flavors. Drink now, with a brief decant.\",\n",
       "         b\"Stalky and grassy smelling, which is par for a Pened\\xc3\\xa8s white blend. There str also apple and lemon-lime notes on the nose. In the mouth, it's lively and spritzy in feel, with pineapple, lime and grassy flavors. Zesty, dry and minerally on the finish, this should pair well with seafood and paella.\",\n",
       "         b\"Developing a golden color, this is already a beautifully mature wine with some sweetness and ripe flavors of yellow fruits and lemon. There's also a touch of honey and spice to this blend of Pinot Gris and Riesling. It's ready to drink.\",\n",
       "         b'Muscular and fruity on the nose, with coffee, mocha and smoky accents. The palate is concentrated and deep, with a jammy mouthfeel and flavors of black fruits, olive, exotic spices and sweetness. Not overly complex but nice in a bullish, black-fruit way. With 13% Carmen\\xc3\\xa8re.',\n",
       "         b'A fresh, citrus flavored wine with attractive fruitiness and a crisp texture. There is a yeasty edge that should vanish and leave just fruit. Because it is mainly made from Chenin Blanc, there is a nutty, honeyed aftertaste.',\n",
       "         b\"From its floral, lime-driven aromas to its citrus and baked-apple flavors, this is a textbook Riesling. It's plump and friendly, offering a mouthfilling texture and easy-drinking appeal at a bargain price. Drink now.\",\n",
       "         b'As befits a reserve wine, this blend was aged in wood for six months. That has given a ripe lightly toasty character to the wine along with its cool crispness that reveals its origin in the mountainous northern Alentejo. The wine is fruity with lemon and melon over the wood. Drink now.',\n",
       "         b\"This Pinot offers bright tart cherry fruit and earthy spice in good proportion and is softly textured. From the remote Mendocino Ridge and aged in entirely French oak, it's still young and exhibiting plenty of oaky toast on the finish.\",\n",
       "         b\"Tangy caramel and fruit drop flavors give a wine that's very drinkable. This is off dry, which gives a soft texture and great fruitiness. It would drink best as an ap\\xc3\\xa9ritif.\",\n",
       "         b'The white version of this popular Portuguese brand is soft, ripe and warmly fruity. Flavors are of fresh apples and green plums, with a lacing of lime juice.',\n",
       "         b\"This is an exceptionally priced wine that allows a glimpse into the power and density of Domdechant Werner's 2015 Rieslings. Yellow peach and nectarine flavors are vivaciously fresh, but there's a lot more than fruitiness here. It's forward and yielding, yet weighty, its richness nuanced by hints of smoke, graphite and caramel. Luscious, mouth clinging texture lingers on the finish.\",\n",
       "         b'Another big, dense expression of the vintage, this has a softness to the tannins that makes it accessible, though the wine will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2017. Cinnamon and clove intermingle with black cherry and currant, finishing in a hint of tobacco.',\n",
       "         b'The nose is reminiscent of dried pine cones and miso. It is only on the palate that some fruit appears: Hints of red cherry mix with the same pine notes and are fringed with pleasant bitterness. The palate is light in weight but concentrated. This calls out for food\\xe2\\x80\\x94think game and mushroom dishes. The finish is juicy, refreshing and moreish.',\n",
       "         b\"Price aside, this is absolutely wonderful Malbec. The nose is pure and toasty, with minerally dark-berry aromas, cola and pastry notes. The palate is so rich and smooth it's like liquid heaven, while flavors of polished blackberry, espresso and mocha pudding finish mellow as can be, like a silk robe coated in Swiss chocolate. Drink through 2016; 170 cases made.\",\n",
       "         b\"This majority varietal wine contains 2% Cabernet Sauvignon, which doesn't help to soften its powerful grip of sturdy tannin and sideshow of oak. Blueberry and chocolate come to the fore slowly between meaty leather and a dusty aroma.\",\n",
       "         b'A classic blend for Gascony of Colombard and Ugni Blanc produces a bright, fruity wine that is light and crisply fresh. It has white currant and citrus flavors with a herbal edge that gives the wine a tangy texture. Drink now.',\n",
       "         b'With integrated aromas of balsam wood, cassis, cherry and mixed spices, this smells elegant and inviting. A concentrated palate is slightly narrow in feel, while flavors of baked plum, cassis, black cherry and hard spices finish with toasty oak and chocolate notes. Drink through 2017.',\n",
       "         b\"Attractive aromas of red berry and blue flower lead the nose on this bright wine. On the palate, notes of beet and mint accent a core of wild strawberry and crunchy red cherry. It's savory and easy drinking thanks to fresh acidity and sleek tannins.\",\n",
       "         b'Nice and silky, and velvety smooth in the mouth, this Pinot offers complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, mocha and sandalwood. Easy to like for its richness and spicy finish. Ready now.',\n",
       "         b\"This blend of 90% Sauvignon Blanc with some Sauvignon Gris and Musque grapes does its best to achieve ripeness, but it's dominated by green flavors of gooseberries, along with a hint of ammonia. Dry and a bit vegetal in style, this barrel-aged wine finishes on a tart note.\",\n",
       "         b\"The label made from cork adds a curiosity value to this big, firmly tannic wine. With its weight, considerable structure and chunky black fruits, it's definitely a wine to age. Give it 5\\xe2\\x80\\x936 years.\",\n",
       "         b'The three castas (grapes) in the blend are Chardonnay, Arinto and Vital. It is a clean, fresh wine that is soft and round. The Chardonnay acidity lifts the two Portuguese grapes. This lightly textured wine is ready to drink now.',\n",
       "         b'This medium-bodied blend of 70% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot offers mature berry and baking spice aromas. On the palate, round tannins temper the ripe black cherry, vanilla and coffee flavors. Drink through 2018.',\n",
       "         b'This family-run vineyard and winery continues to excite, delivering delicious, broadly appealing aromas of caramelized yellow pears with a cinnamon-butter glaze, honey-laced pineapple and lemon soda. The creamy mouthfeel carries flavors of yellow cake, lemon custard and warm peach, yet candied grapefruit peel carves a sharp line down the middle.',\n",
       "         b'Lots of fresh, zingy acidity in this dry, young Chardonnay, and the steely minerality gives it a tang of cold metal. There are tantalizing hints of ripe citrus fruit and apricots. Give it 4\\xe2\\x80\\x935 years in the cellar to come around.',\n",
       "         b'Attractive, fresh and rich with pretty mineral notes, this Fiano does a fine job of representing southern Italy. The wine is brilliant and streamlined with peach, citrus and yellow flower. Pair it with seafood risotto. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.',\n",
       "         b\"No one will ever complain that this Napa Valley-Sonoma County blend isn't fruity enough. It's deliciously explosive in jammy blackberries, cassis, cherries and milk chocolate. Oak adds notes of caramel. But flavor isn't everything, and this wine would benefit from greater restraint and structural integrity.\",\n",
       "         b'Fruity and lemony, this is a bright and fresh wine with just a touch of steeliness. Almonds come through at the end.',\n",
       "         b'There is an obvious vanilla, toasty character to this wine from the wood fermentation. That balances with the lemon and pear fruits and the tight texture. The wine is still young with great fruit potential, so drink from 2018.',\n",
       "         b\"The nose is still a bit closed, but the palate is more expressive and accessible. It delivers ripe black cherry, sweet raspberry, subtle oak, vanilla and espresso flavors alongside firm tannins. It's good now but will be better after 2018.\",\n",
       "         b'Aromas of oak, espresso, toast, vanilla and chocolate carry over to the palate, along with licorice and coffee notes. It has structure but not quite enough richness to support the evident oak sensations.',\n",
       "         b'Dominated by the local Castel\\xc3\\xa3o grape, this easy-drinking, fruity wine has soft tannins, attractive acidity and blackberry fruit. Juicy and soft, this is a classic barbecue wine.',\n",
       "         b'Delicate aromas of hawthorn, white spring flower and a whiff of orchard fruit aromas lead the nose on this refined sparkler. The vibrant palate doles yellow apple, citrus zest and toasted breadcrumb accompanied by an elegant mousse.',\n",
       "         b'Steeped prune, vanilla, resin, exotic spice and crushed blue flower aromas lead the way on this concentrated wine. The rich, dense palate delivers blackberry jam, raisin, licorice and mocha while firm, glossy tannins provide structure.',\n",
       "         b'A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Barbera and Nebbiolo (in decreasing amounts), this opens with green aromas of dried herb and olive, followed by hints of black fruit and tobacco. It also shows bright acidity and good structure on the finish.',\n",
       "         b\"This has a dense bouquet, with aromas of beet, clove, mint, tomato and berry fruit. The mouthfeel is rich and saturated, with a rawness that didn't exist in prior years. Flavors of mixed herb, earth and savory berry end with a long finish.\",\n",
       "         b'This is a fruit-driven, medium-bodied ros\\xc3\\xa9 of Grenache (60%) and Mourv\\xc3\\xa8dre (40%). While not the most complex ros\\xc3\\xa9, the yellow-fleshed, red-skinned plum flavors are potent, lingering on the mouthwatering finish.',\n",
       "         b\"Structured and dense, this wine comes from the remains of a quarry on the hill of Corton. From the Louis Latour domaine, it is powerful and packed with black fruits, rich while still with the freshness of the year. It has a good future, so don't drink before 2023.\",\n",
       "         b'Edgy tannins are the star in this young Cabernet. They give the wine a gritty feeling, making it hard to embrace the ripe blackberry, black cherry and currant flavors. The dryness, fine acidity and overall balance suggest this will have no trouble negotiating the next 10 years in the cellar.',\n",
       "         b'Reedy weedy aromas include notes of motor oil and leafy berry fruits. This tastes as weedy as it smells, with underripe herbal berry flavors that never shed an overriding green essence.',\n",
       "         b\"There's an attractive minty note to this wine that some may find too prominent, but the underlying cassis fruit is strong and the wine's structure is firm. The tannins are even a bit chewy at this stage, so either give it a year or two to mellow or pair it with some rare beef or lamb.\",\n",
       "         b'This is a ripe wine with generous black fruits and crisp acidity. It is balanced\\xe2\\x80\\x94fruity with a core of tannins. Drink from 2018.',\n",
       "         b'Easy-drinking and straightforward, this approachable Pinot offers bright notes of red cherry, blueberry and strawberry framed by dusty tannins and a softly herbal finish.',\n",
       "         b'Quite dark (perhaps from the small additions of Petit Verdot and Merlot), and scented with a burnt edge, this Tempranillo is slow to show much fruit. Tart raspberry notes seem to quickly resolve into a charred, slightly bitter finish.',\n",
       "         b'Has the richness, weight and texture of a barrel-fermented Chardonnay, but with spicier, tangier flavors. They range from green apples and nectarines all the way over to mangoes, papayas and vanilla bean.',\n",
       "         b'This ripe wine has tropical fruits, pineapple and apricots as well as a fresher lime character. The wine is rounded with a crisper edge. Drink now.',\n",
       "         b'The instant appeal of seductive Pinot Noir is here, with its ripe fruits that are poised between sweetness and a pure line of acidity. The fruit is juicy, but always fresh, with wild strawberry flavors and just some spice from wood.',\n",
       "         b'While this Cab may be a touch soupy and heavy on the nose, aromas of coffee grounds and berry fruits are good. A full, blocky palate features cheek-rubbing tannins, while this tastes of coffee, chocolate and herbal berry fruits. For everyday purposes, this makes the grade.',\n",
       "         b\"Just-ripe blackberry forms a tight, centralized core aroma, with flashes of pencil lead, dried rose petals and lavender adding nuance. It's focused and dark on the palate, with grippy pine sap stringing together purple fruit, dried cranberry and black pepper flavors.\",\n",
       "         b'A little scattered and jumbled at first, but once things settle this Bordeaux blend is impressive. Scents of clove, blackberry and grape candy are sincere, while the palate houses blueberry, cassis and other black-fruit flavors. The feel is tannic and a bit choppy, but the ribald finish of bacon, leather, vanilla and resin is convincing. Drink now through 2011.',\n",
       "         b\"Raspingly dry and fierce in tannins, this Merlot is quite different from other Bordeaux-style red wines from Oakville that are ripe and lush. Doesn't offer much reward now due to the astringency, but has a solid core of blackberries. Hard to know if the fruit will outlast the tannins.\",\n",
       "         b\"The wine has ripe Merlot with red-berry fruit flavors and balanced tannins. It's fresh with the acidity of the year. Here it is contrasted with spice, a smooth surface texture and a ripe cherry aftertaste. This is an attractive wine to drink from 2017.\",\n",
       "         b\"There's a certain elegance to this Dolcetto that distinguishes it in a crowd. The fruit element is bright and strong and the wine shows generous layers of raspberry and cherry on the close.\",\n",
       "         b'Sweet and extra ripe, this pushes the peach and apricot fruit to a rich and focused center, and keeps the impact of new French oak at just 20%. Which is plenty, adding just enough sweet and toasty vanilla to the extended, rich finish.',\n",
       "         b\"Caramel, oak and intensely ripe mango and peach flavors mark this Chardonnay. It's simple and straightforward, but pleasant drinking.\",\n",
       "         b'Crisply aromatic, this is a light, bright wine. Citrus fruit and a tangy orange and mineral texture create a light, bright aftertaste. It is refreshing and ready to drink.',\n",
       "         b\"Intensely aromatic, intensely fruity, this Riesling packs a powerful punch of flavor within a delicate frame. The fruit profile is tropical with concentrated guava and mango flavors spiced with hints of white pepper. It's semi-sweet in style, but bracing acidity leaves the finish quite dry.\",\n",
       "         b'The cold vintage compromised this wine, giving it high acidity and unripe flavors of green peppercorns, citrus fruits, dried hay and ammonia.',\n",
       "         b'Acidity marks this ripe, delicious wine, giving it a tartness that works to balance the extraordinarily ripe flavors. Cherries, black raspberries, mulberries and pomegranates all mingle together, with spice and cedar complications, and the finish is totally dry and somewhat tannic. Great now, and should hold for a good six years.',\n",
       "         b\"Enticing scents of wild red berry, baking spice, aromatic herb and a balsamic note waft out of the glass. The elegant, juicy palate doles out succulent wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and a note of white pepper while a mineral note backs up the finish. It's well balanced, with bright acidity and ultrafine tannins.\",\n",
       "         b\"This smooth and supple Chardonnay from northeast Italy boasts steadfast intensity and pretty aromas of citrus blossom, peach, honey and a touch of fresh vanilla bean. The wine's creamy density makes for a natural companion to pasta and lasagna.\",\n",
       "         b'Fresh and juicy, this opens with alluring aromas of ripe plum, violet, sunbaked soil and dark spice. The bright, silky palate offers crushed blackberry, succulent cherry, clove and star anise alongside supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018.',\n",
       "         b'From a steep, densely planted estate vineyard, this is a lilting regional example of well-integrated oak in support of black raspberry, licorice and chalky clove. Silky tannins mark it most, providing a balance to the fruit and a pronounced, entirely delectable bite of black pepper on the finish.',\n",
       "         b\"From the producer's oldest estate vineyard, planted in 1970, this is lovely in rose petals and baked fruit, offering a powerful density of full-bodied concentration and succulence on the palate. A velvety texture is complemented by a bite of oak and tannin that flirts with grip.\",\n",
       "         b'Almost over the top, this beautiful Barolo from the most celebrated cru of them all\\xe2\\x80\\x94the iconic Cannubi vineyard\\xe2\\x80\\x94delivers maximum pleasure and intensity. This is a soft and velvety wine, with cherry, cassis, leather, moist tobacco and licorice aromas over extracted concentration and tight tannins. The wine needs more time to age and once it does, it can be paired with beef or aged cheeses.',\n",
       "         b'Yellow mirabelle plums are just hinted at on the nose. They become clearer on the palate where they are joined by a generous dollop of white pepper and creamy yeast.',\n",
       "         b\"Lightly herbal on the nose, but overall there's more ripe berry and toasty chocolate aromas than green. Full, meaty and deep for a value-priced wine, with blackberry and black plum flavors along with a pinch of oregano and basil. Shows good weight and balance throughout. Impressive for a 50,000-case product.\",\n",
       "         b\"A fine Chardonnay, front-loaded with tropical fruit, Asian pear, and green apple flavors, with rich honey and vanilla from charred oak barrels. With a crunch of acidity, it's Trefethen's best Chardonnay in years.\",\n",
       "         b\"There's a stewy rustiness to this wine on the entry, an evocative recall of the old country, when grandfather made wine in his basement. From a high-elevation vineyard site, it takes time to open. Once it does, the full-bodied expression of juicy blackberry and leather combine to nice effect.\",\n",
       "         b\"A floral, heavy style of blended white made from Macabeo, Gew\\xc3\\xbcrztraminer and Chardonnay. It has an exotic streak to the aromas along with smoked ham, fennel seed and gardenia. The palate is thick and tastes of papaya, salami and baked apple. It's a hodgepodge of abnormal aromas and flavors, but all totaled it works pretty well.\",\n",
       "         b'Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016\\xe2\\x80\\x932020.',\n",
       "         b'After this Rioja opens with earthy, almost food-like aromas of ground beef, rubber and leather, oak takes over and in march a bacony scent and plenty of char. This is plump and chunky in feel, with earthy, rubbery, savory flavors of charred black fruits and cured meats. It becomes more and more oaky and drawing on the finish.',\n",
       "         b'Mild berry and cherry aromas are standard and slightly oaky. The palate on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is choppy and tannic, while earthy flavors of cherry and plum are pushed by firm acids. This finishes tannic, with coffee and herbal flavors.',\n",
       "         b\"A solid effort, this basic red blend features mint accents layered over slightly herbal cassis aromas and flavors. It's medium-bodied, with silky tannins on the finish. Drink now.\",\n",
       "         b'Raspberry and plum aromas start with a resiny oak covering that turns foresty and briary with airing. This is raisiny and ripe in feel, with a complex mix of berry, fennel and anise flavors. A lush, dense-feeling finish is minty and herbal.',\n",
       "         b\"Hints of crushed slate lend a smoky, flinty character to concentrated flavors of tangerine and quince preserve in this beautiful off-dry Riesling. It's intensely fruity, but anchored in minerality from start to finish.\",\n",
       "         b'A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Franc, this nonvintage wine displays aromas of vanilla, green pepper, woodspice and herbs. The sweet chocolate and cherry flavors are accented by light meaty notes.',\n",
       "         b\"This is top Champagne from Piper-Heidsieck, offering the delicious airy quality that's the hallmark of this house, with crisp apple flavor, tangy acidity and the first signs of yeasty, toasty bottle age. Its fruit intensity has transformed into a splendid selection. It's worth aging for a few more years, though also delicious now.\",\n",
       "         b\"Young and tightly wound, this wine from the family's Olivet Lane Vineyard is reduced and generous in oak and spicy dark cherry, its aromas resplendent in rose petal. Layered and soft, it's big on complexity and plush textures, with a lengthy, caramel-and cola-laced finish.\",\n",
       "         b'Sweet oak tones frame the black cherry and currant fruit in this wine, with notes of mocha and raspberry sauce atop. The velvety texture offers good tannic grip, while ample acidity helps to keep the palate fresh and the finish lifted. Drink now.',\n",
       "         b'The initial impression of this wine is lean and austere. Lively acidity and a firm, dark, magnificent structure brings out intense flavors of plum skins. It needs several years in the bottle to show its best. Drink from 2018.',\n",
       "         b'A lovely Zinfandel, soft and dry, with luscious cherry, raspberry and sandalwood flavors, dusted with pepper and cocoa. Easy to drink and versatile with everything from pizza to a grilled steak.',\n",
       "         b\"Zesty lemon and lime acidity takes center stage in this invigorating medium-dry kabinett. It's leaner and more linear than the producer's regular-label kabinett, but offers loads of cutting white grapefruit and red apple flavors. The finish is refreshing and penetrating, lingering on a note of sugar cookie.\",\n",
       "         b'Fruity aromas of ripe red berry and mature plum are accompanied by whiffs of baking spice and fennel. The palate offers oak, espresso, licorice and toast framed by astringent, woody tannins.',\n",
       "         b'A light touch in the aroma and rather delicate fruit and spice flavors fashion an elegant style for this light- to medium-bodied wine. Its reserve and delicacy are positive attributes for drinking before the meal or with it.',\n",
       "         b'The wine is earthy, leathery and leafy on the nose. In the mouth, hard tannins lead to a stalky tasting, lightly baked set of mature black-fruit flavors. Carob and raisin flavors along with rubbery tannins define the finish',\n",
       "         b'This is scoury in the mouth, with edgy corners framing straightforward orange and lime flavors. The midpalate is marked delicately with leesy sourdough notes.',\n",
       "         b\"This Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend is very much in a Washington style, with crisp acids and tart berry and currant flavors, wrapped in chocolate and showing a few specks of pepper, presumably from the Syrah. It's solid and well-made and a good example of how Oregon vintners are breaking out of the Pinot box.\",\n",
       "         b\"This is a ripe, fresh and fruity wine that's filled out with a tangy, mineral texture. Grapefruit and lime juice flavors give a zesty feel as well as intense acidity. It is ready to drink.\",\n",
       "         b'In the ongoing debate about how well Muscadet can age, this wine gives a good answer: yes it can. There is no sign of the fruit declining; in fact it seems to have become richer and fuller. The texture has softened to give a smooth, creamy wine that is still bright, although very ready to drink.',\n",
       "         b\"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.\",\n",
       "         b'This estate-grown Chardonnay comes from one of the most expressive sites in the Yakima Valley. In this cooler vintage, it puts the accent on elegance. A judicious mix of apple, pear and peach fruit is matched with toasty accents from 100% barrel fermentation.',\n",
       "         b\"Aromatically speaking, there's bacon and plastic-like notes to the nose along with generic berry scents. The palate is medium in size and intense, with bold cherry and plum flavors as well as oaky backing. It finishes short, with rubbery accents and a distinct clove flavor.\",\n",
       "         b'Rock solid, this substantial Merlot is grounded in earth flavors, laced with butter cookie, and finished with tart tannins. The fruit is tight and tangy.',\n",

       "         b\"This wine would make a great impression on an elegantly dressed table with a fine meat-based menu. The wine's natural structure and freshness make it very food friendly and its elegant aromas of cassis, small berry, cola and white truffle will evolve beautifully throughout your meal.\",\n",
       "         b'Loaded with finesse, this bright creamy wine hits all the right buttons. It opens with lovely scents of acacia flower and white stone fruit while the polished silky palate delivers yellow apple, ripe pear and lemon zest alongside fresh acidity. An elegant mousse lends suppleness.',\n",
       "         b\"The best of Belle Glos's 2008 Pinots. It's notable for the extreme richness of the raspberries and cherries, which have a jammy intensity with even more succulent notes of vanilla cream and smoky butter. But the finish is dry, while acidity and tannins bring the wine to earth. Delicious now and through 2014.\",\n",
       "         b'Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.',\n",
       "         b'Aromas of pure black fruit, slightly burned toast, concentrated plum, black cherries and a touch of espresso show on this study of a rarely standalone grape. The palate is firm with chewy tannins yet approachable in flavors, offering dried elderberries, coffee beans, burned caramel flavors.',\n",
       "         b'This straightforward wine opens with aromas that recall underbrush, white mushroom, dark berries and blue flower. The one-dimensional palate is a bit shy on freshness but offers ripe black cherry with hints of white pepper and espresso alongside tightly-knit tannins.',\n",
       "         b'Fresh and juicy this has the potential to be an attractive wine, with black-currant crispness as well as supporting tannins. The balance is developing and the wine will be ready to drink from 2019. The property is owned by Bernard Thomassin; his son Arnaud restructured vineyards for higher quality. A fire in 2011 resulted in construction of a new winery.',\n",
       "         b\"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.\",\n",
       "         b'Ripe and fruity, this is a wine made for drinking soon. It has ripe black-plum fruit, structured tannins and a juicy and smoky character that is already delicious.',\n",
       "         b'Minty at first, and herbal, the way a Cabernet can be, this Petit Verdot from Lodi is juicy and well made with licorice and spice and plenty of tannin structure. Its limp finish could signal the need for a bit more time in the cellar, perhaps 2\\xe2\\x80\\x935 years.',\n",
       "         b\"Compact cherry, plum and cassis aromas are nice. In the mouth, this is ruled by snappy edgy acidity. Flavors that match the nose finish raw, with blazing residual acidity. There's probably no limit to how long this Graciano will last; drink through 2030.\",\n",
       "         b'This ripe, fruity and perfumed wine is delicious. Juicy red and black fruits ooze from every part of its smoky structure. It comes from vines on a small plateau called Pisse-Vieille in Brouilly. The wine is ready to drink for its fruity pleasure.',\n",
       "         b'On the nose, this smells of burnt oak, raisin and ultraripe cherry. The palate is compact and heavy, with chewy density. Baked, rooty flavors of cola, prune and chocolaty oak finish with thick, candied berry residuals.',\n",
       "         b'This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot is genuine and direct, with deep aromas of berry fruit, spice, herbs and cherries.',\n",
       "         b\"Part of the natural wine movement, this blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon comes from organically farmed fruit. There's a touch of heat on the palate, with aromas of cherry liqueur, jammy blackberry and exotic spice that drive the bold and masculine mouthfeel.\",\n",
       "         b'The wine comes from a parcel of land planted with both Merlot and Tannat. In its structure, this great wine has a strong connection to the Madirans that are the hallmark of this producer. With maturity, the wine has developed fine secondary flavors and undergrowth and dried-fruit flavors. The wine, named after a standing stone found in the area, is very ready to drink.',\n",
       "         b'L\\xc3\\xb6wengang is one of the few Italian white wines built to age many long years in the cellar. Chardonnay is farmed according to bio-dynamic ideals and shaped by oak barrique. The result is creamy, rich, structured and redolent of apricot, vanilla, citrus cream and spice.',\n",
       "         b\"Nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this red doesn't skimp on richness nor oak, showing layers of chocolate liqueur and coconut flake. Soft, mellow tannin that retains some dustiness rides alongside juicy boysenberry.\",\n",
       "         b'Herbal tomato and red-berry aromas are jumbled and fail to state much of a case for this multigrape blend. Herbal spicy tea and raspberry flavors finish jagged, with mild heat.',\n",
       "         b\"There's a lightly spritzy tickle in the mouth, and a metallic undertaste to this Chardonnay. The blend includes 5% each Pinot Gris and Sauvignon Blanc, all done in stainless steel. Thin and a bit green, it does not quite come together.\",\n",
       "         b'Perfumey violet and leather mingle on the nose before a taste of softened cedar, leather pouch and tobacco hit the palate. Robust tannins and oak follow, mellowing over time with air and a swirl or two. Cigar-tinged tobacco revisits on the finish.',\n",
       "         b'This opens with funky but not unpleasant aromas that soon burn off to reveal earthy notes and mature black fruit. The palate shows a very ripe\\xe2\\x80\\x94almost overripe\\xe2\\x80\\x94blackberry flavor, with mushroom and tobacco leaf accents. While the ripe fruit still has immediate appeal, this is getting tired, so drink soon.',\n",
       "         b\"What a great wine this is. It combines Chardonnay's rich, creamy texture with Sauvignon Blanc's dry, tart, lemony flavors to yield a complex wine that's a joy to drink. The acidic, peppery finish begs for food to accompany it. A very great value.\",\n",
       "         b'Dark jammy aromas of herbal blackberry and coffee are heady. In the mouth, this is full and fleshy. Lightly stewed blackberry, black currant and peppercorn flavors finish savory, herbal, blackened and oaky. Drink through 2021.',\n",
       "         b'This wine is a unique blend of Syrah, Merlot, Viognier, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourv\\xc3\\xa8dre. It seems locked up, with aromas of pickling spices, smoke, berry and vanilla that are followed by broad blue and black-fruit flavors that provide appeal.',\n",
       "         b\"Made entirely from Nero d'Avola, this opens with black-skinned berry, freshly turned soil and cooking spice aromas. The soft, juicy palate offers blackberry, carob and clove flavors while rounded tannins lend a smooth texture. Enjoy through 2019.\",\n",
       "         b\"To get the best results, you'd better chill this one down. That way you'll get more of the refreshing apple and pear element of the wine and less of its fat, chunky body and rough, unpolished edges.\",\n",
       "         b'This Grenache-based cuv\\xc3\\xa9e is medium-bodied and crisp in feel. Black cherries and chocolate mingle easily on the palate, but the wine finishes dry and astringent. Serve with rare beef or lamb for best enjoyment.',\n",
       "         b'This is a young wine with a lean texture and stalky fruit from a Chablis-based producer. It feels cool with its acidity and red-currant fruits. Drink now.',\n",
       "         b\"Low in alcohol for a Syrah, this shows light, underripe flavors of strawberry and white pepper. Not particularly complex, it's maturing quickly and should be consumed over the next couple of years.\",\n",
       "         b'Tropical papaya meets moderate acidity in this lush, creamy and voluptuous version of the variety, complemented by enough minerality to cut through the fleshy ripeness. The oak impact is subtle and plays a supporting role, never distracting from the fruit.',\n",
       "         b\"Here's a concentrated Valpolicella that opens with aromas of new leather, truffle, French oak and a balsamic note. The firm palate shows raisin, fig and oak-driven spice alongside close-grained tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.\",\n",
       "         b'Half Malbec and half Petit Verdot, the barrel notes of vanilla and pencil lead play off cherry and purple flowers with citrusy acidity and firm, dry tannins providing the frame.',\n",
       "         b'A bit on the light-bodied side, but nice and dry, with plenty of personality. The flavors are of briary, brambly wild blackberries, raspberries and blueberries, dusted with black pepper and cinnamon.',\n",
       "         b'This elegant Rosso opens with an intense and alluring fragrance of rose, blue flower and crushed red berries. The palate is more evolved than the fresh aromas suggest, delivering ripe black raspberry and crushed red cherry lightly accented with cinnamon-spice. A note of orange zest marks the close.',\n",
       "         b\"It's sad that only 5,080 bottles of this wine were produced, as it's truly a stunner. Dark and developed, complex and concentrated, this wine exhibits such superb balance and finesse, with nuanced notes of minerality, scrubland, whole tobacco leaf, black pepper and licorice root all gracing the dark fruit core of the nose and mouth. It's lush and full on the palate, and medium tannins provide a solid structure, making the wine drinkable now or ready to age.\",\n",
       "         b'This structured wine has acidity and a broad base of black fruits. It is concentrated and firm, but with the fruitiness of the vintage. Drink this already-attractive wine from 2018.',\n",
       "         b'Tons of ripe, jammy blueberry, cherry and blackberry fruit in this delicious wine, with the most scrumptious caramel sweetness. Easy to like with almost anything calling for a fruity red wine.',\n",
       "         b\"It is amazing that 134,000 cases of this budget bottling can be made to this level of quality. From a classic vintage, it's structured and substantial, overcoming the somewhat overdone vanilla flavors with great fruit and firm acids.\",\n",
       "         b'This is an off-dry and lightly structured wine that has a crisp, mineral texture. It is bright, with citrus and apple notes that are cut by tangy lemon peel. The finish is tight and direct; drink now.',\n",
       "         b'This wine offers an aromatic medley of sweet cherry fruit and chalky mineral tones. This Merlot with 10% Sangiovese has great texture and a threadwork of blueberry fruit, Pez candy and drying, dusty tannins on the finish.',\n",
       "         b\"There's no oak on this wine, but it sure doesn't lack in richness. Offers a blast of lemons, limes, pineapples, honeysuckle flowers, vanilla and smoky butter, brightened with crisp acidity. The grapes come from Yountville.\",\n",
       "         b\"This is a light, fruity wine with fresh red berry flavors and soft tannins. It has a cool feel from the nearby Atlantic Ocean, giving a bright, character and a wine that's ready to drink.\",\n",
       "         b'From the mountainous far north of Italy, this smooth Pinot Bianco is rounded out by aromas of melon, stone fruit and honey. It presents a creamy mouthfeel with a fresh, palate-cleansing finish.',\n",
       "         b'Lots of acidity in this fresh young Pinot. Oak, too, which gives dominating aromas and flavors of toast and caramel. Underneath is a rich wine, filled with raspberry, cola, saut\\xc3\\xa9ed mushroom and spice flavors. Should develop over the next 2\\xe2\\x80\\x933 years.',\n",
       "         b'Marked by both reduction and oak, this wine feels lifted with acidity, opening in a vibrant shock of strawberry and Mandarin orange. Velvety layers subtle tannin carry a spicy finish of clove and salty sea air. A beautifully balanced, complete wine.',\n",
       "         b\"While the wine is structured, it does also have plenty of ripe, juicy fruitiness that is already delicious. It's an open wine, rounded and rich in fruit flavor. The tannins are likely to smooth out soon, so drink from 2016.\",\n",
       "         b'Shows some pretty good acids and tannins, which makes the wine feel juicy and brisk in candied blackberry and cherry fruit. Finishes almost sweet, but not quite, with the tannins closing in and drying things out. The impression is of an immature wine, not showing well now. Give it 5\\xe2\\x80\\x936 years in the cellar.',\n",
       "         b'Solid and dense, this shows the structure and concentration from the famed C\\xc3\\xb4te du Py in Morgon. It has a lot of tannins at the moment, although the potential of the red berry fruit and acidity is evident. Age this for four years.',\n",
       "         b'Dark and brawny, this opens with almost impenetrable concentration and bold aromas of jammy fruit, blackberry, espresso, cedar and moist tobacco. It has a smooth, rich texture, with lively highlights of teriyaki, ginger and cola.',\n",
       "         b'It is the power that is so evident in this wine - a full, up-front expression of Merlot at its most powerful. It is somewhat closed up at this stage, but it is going to continue its development as an enormous wine which still manages to keep its power under firm control.',\n",
       "         b\"Entropy only made 30 cases of this SB, sourced from the Blanches Vineyard in Livermore Valley. It's a tad thin, made in the grassy style of the variety.\",\n",
       "         b'This is full of bitter marmalade and maple syrup flavors while also showing considerable wood-aging flavors. It is structured, still showing some hints of fruit while also bringing out a strongly mature character.',\n",
       "         b'Possibly too rich, this is a full, sumptuous wine. It has great weight, density, a smooth, wood-aged character that shows through the sweet plums. For what it is, a very rich wine that shows some pepper alcohol\\xe2\\x80\\x94it offers a juicy character and ageability. Drink from 2016.',\n",
       "         b\"Beaucoup d'oak. Delicious, toasty, roasty, mocha-flavored oak. But the fruit is missing in action. The color suggests that there is some light, plummy fruit underlying all the oak, but it's hiding.\",\n",
       "         b'Full-bodied and elegant, this opens with aromas of mature orchard fruit, crushed stone and nut. The linear, structured palate boasts more complexity than most Pinot Grigios, offering ripe pear, toasted almond, mineral and dollop of acacia honey. Drink through 2020.',\n",
       "         b'Meaty, dusty aromas of leather, cigar box, old books, roasted lamb, tobacco smoke and purple flowers make for a compelling nose on this wine. The palate is quite leathery, with beef crust, wood smoke and incense ash flavors, delivered in a smooth manner.',\n",
       "         b'This vibrant, polished red opens with a potpourri of red berry, floral and spice aromas. The bright, juicy palate doles out succulent red cherry, raspberry, anise and cinnamon while lithe tannins and lively acidity provide balance and a smooth, easy-drinking texture.',\n",
       "         b\"This wine's a steal for the price, a no-oak white that's stony, tropical, ripe and simple. It'll serve well at larger gatherings or anytime with friends sitting on the porch or picnic blanket, staying balanced and refreshing in the glass.\",\n",
       "         b\"Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish. While there are too many soft and overripe Zins, this one goes pretty far the other way.\",\n",
       "         b'This is a small, 10-acre property, owned by the Moueix family, at the heart of the Pomerol plateau. With its 30% Cabernet Franc it is perfumed and ripe, giving delicious black fruits as well as a firmer structure. The wine is set for a long aging with great potential. Drink from 2024.',\n",
       "         b\"Smells a bit cheesy and leathery, with mint and slightly chemical berry aromas. Chewy in feel, with buttery flavors of red berry and chocolate. Tastes oaky, minty and forced, but overall it's not a bad wine given the price and subpar vintage.\",\n",
       "         b\"Shows the firm tannins and full-bodied richness of Petite Sirah, but it's not an ager because it's a little too low in acid for the long haul. So enjoy it now for the wealth of blackberries, cherries, anise and mocha.\",\n",
       "         b'Tinges of saffron, pollen and hay lend a spicy, earthy undertone to this slick, honeyed ice wine. The palate is richly concentrated with sweet stone fruit and candied orange peel flavors bolstered by plush tangerine acidity.',\n",
       "         b'A rounded wine, surprisingly soft for a Pauillac. The tannins are ripe, with chocolate and sweet black currant fruit flavors along with spice and some toast.',\n",
       "         b'This opens with aromas that recall toast, French oak, coffee bean and tilled soil. The palate is straightforward and a bit lean, offering notes of dried black cherry, vanilla and mocha accompanied by fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2019.',\n",
       "         b\"The blend is classic Bordeaux\\xe2\\x80\\x9485% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.\",\n",
       "         b\"There's plenty of cherry pie, red currant, mushroom and sandalwood flavor in this dry Cab Franc, which was blended with a little Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot for complexity. It feels stylish, yet there's a tough, astringent mouthfeel that seems unlikely ever to go away.\",\n",
       "         b\"Named after the winery owners' kids Niki and Kiara, this blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Malbec, 14% Petit Verdot, 12% Cabernet Franc and 4% Merlot offers roasted game and subtle blackberries on the nose. It's more complex on the palate, with smoked plums leading into licorice and coffee in the midpalate, finishing on nice and easy tannins.\",\n",
       "         b\"Light mint and herbal aromas get it going, followed by dry, complex scents of tobacco, licorice, leather and blackberry. This is 80% Cabernet and 20% Merlot, and it's a bit angular on the tongue but the flavors of cassis, black cherry and plum are juicy and bold. Turns more oaky with airing, especially on the long, herbal finish.\",\n",
       "         b'Teso la Monja picked a good vintage to introduce this entry-level Toro. Romanico is big and candied on the nose, with floral berry aromas, milk chocolate and a touch of raisin. On the palate, spunky berry fruit flavors blend with juniper notes, while the finish delivers herbal leftovers, a pinch more juniper and commendable length and smoothness.',\n",
       "         b'Now maturing, this wine still retains some of the freshness of the vintage. It also has spicy blackberry fruits, rich tannins and a full, powerful finish. Drink now, or keep for 2\\xe2\\x80\\x933 years.',\n",

Lemon peel, lime zest and crisp nectarine show on the nose while the palate's sparkling acidity reveals flavors of white flowers, lemon cream and pear, all wrapped around a steely core.\",\n",
       "         b'In color, this could be a white wine with just the faintest hint of pink when seen against a white surface. Luckily, the fruit is still there, offering flavors of tangy orange and red currant. It has pepper and spice as well as final refreshing acidity. Drink now.',\n",
       "         b'Aromatically speaking, this is shaky due to murky earthy berry aromas that suggest peanut butter. In the mouth, this is compact and fairly full. Collapsed berry and plum flavors include notes of gritty earthy spice, while this is blocky and pounding on the finish.',\n",
       "         b'This is a highly unusual, quirky blend of the Georgian Rkatsiteli and Moldovan Sereksiya grapes. Tonic and crisp, it offers robust peach and apple flavors on the attack, but fades a bit quickly on the midpalate. Straightforward but refreshing.',\n",
       "         b\"A nice glass of Cab for $13. It's bone dry, with a scour of sandpapery tannins, and hints of cherries, blackberries, plums, cola and cedar. Shows real class for a statewide-appellated Cab at this price.\",\n",
       "         b'This is a dark-hued wine that brings out the structure and strong minerality of Touriga Nacional in its home region of D\\xc3\\xa3o. It is a powerful and dense selection, still dominated by tannins but offers plenty of perfumed fruit to balance. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       "         b'This is a serious, impressive wine. Fermented in open stone tanks and wood aged, it has a rich texture that encompasses the ripe black fruits and the spicy tannins.

       "         b\"The 2007 Excelsus is a gorgeous super Tuscan expression (with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) that shows quality and superior fruit on all levels.

The wine's texture is exceedingly smooth, rich and long lasting.\",\n",

       "         b'From a warm year, this smells toasty and oaky more than anything. In the mouth, core acidity is driving and creates a sharp, racy feel, while woody flavors of tropical fruits and melon finish with oak-based cinnamon and spice as well as a resiny texture.',\n",
       "         b\"There's a little oak on this Chard, but you can hardly detect it. The flavors are all about ripe pineapples, oranges, peaches and apricots, accented by crisp acidity. A fine example of coastal California Chardonnay, it will marry well with grilled salmon.\",\n",

       "         b'Starting to show its age with a pale golden hue, this fum\\xc3\\xa9 is classy and restrained. Aromas of waxy lemon, pineapple and green bean mingle with base notes of butterscotch and smoke from the oak. The palate offers less excitement with the fruit disappearing some and searing acidity taking over. Nevertheless, this wine would be a versatile pairing for a variety of dishes.',\n",

       "         b\"A Rh\\xc3\\xb4ne-style blend that's rich in cola, blackberry and cherry jam and oak flavors. The tannins are fine and ripe, while acidity is on the soft side, giving the wine a certain directness. Yet it's nicely dry and clean. Drink now.\",\n",
       "         b'The nose of this wine is all about oak, with toast and char leading the way. The palate follows suit yet shows a bit more fruit, with grilled red-berry flavors washing over a lithe, crisp palate.',\n",
       "         b'This D\\xc3\\xa3o grape makes a firmly dry and tannic wine at this young stage. The hints of blackberry fruit and acidity promise a fine future of a rich wine with stylish, mineral-driven fruitiness. Drink this promising wine from 2018.',\n",
       "         b\"This is a classically crafted wine made by one of Montepulciano's most historic estates. It has an alluring bouquet of violet, rose petal, cassis and nutmeg. The palate delivers an intense wild-cherry flavor layered with white pepper and cinnamon, all impeccably balanced by firm tannins and vibrant acidity. Caffo Beverages Inc, Kiwi Distributing.\",\n",
       "         b\"DTR is Domaine de la Terre Rouge's home site, planted in 1999, and its coolest. Given that, the aromas suggest more ripeness than would be expected, a heady mix of plum and brambly berry, with an undertone of minerality that keeps things zipping along.\",\n",
       "         b'This block selection shows a delicate, elegant touch in this vintage, opening with pretty floral accents and continuing with light but compelling flavors of citrus and honeysuckle. There is a well-tuned bitter streak, presumably from some skin contact, and a refreshing minerality throughout.',\n",
       "         b'Deep ruby in the glass, this wine offers a bouquet of cassis and strawberry. It is bright at first sip, but chalky tannins quickly make their presence known amidst flavors of black cherry, anise and juniper berry that come to a head in a pleasantly bitter apple-peel finish.',\n",
       "         b\"Sangiovese doesn't do well in California as a dry table wine but it makes a pretty good ros\\xc3\\xa9. The grape's naturally high acidity frames its classic cherry flavors, which are deliciously clean and pure in this steel-fermented wine. Best of all, the wine is relatively low in alcohol and dry. Try this polished ros\\xc3\\xa9 with sushi.\",\n",
       "         b'Earthy yeastiness combined with soft lemon freshness creates a very savory wine. While the palate has umami-like spice, it also has a linear lick of clean lemon acid. The two work in contrast and will show their best with a mixed cheese platter.',\n",
       "         b'This is an exciting wine, simultaneously serious and fun, with a steely minerality and clean nectarine on the nose. The palate is energetic, showing both tight limestone and more deliciously hedonistic notes of Fuji apples and Japanese pear. The acidity kicks expertly throughout.',\n",
       "         b'Starts off with aromas of grapefruit and tomato leaf, then touches of nectarine and honey on the palate add richness and depth. The result is a medium-bodied, round Sauvignon Blanc with a subtle, elegant finish.',\n",
       "         b\"Spicy and minty on the nose, with hard primary aromas and lots of cinnamon. There isn't much fruit or body to this youngster, which seems wood-infused and short on substance. 45,000 cases made.\",\n",
       "         b'Fragrant and fresh, this Grillo opens with alluring scents of acacia flower, beeswax and white stone fruit. The succulent palate offers creamy white peach, juicy nectarine, almond and mineral framed in tangy acidity. A note of chopped herb closes the lingering finish.',\n",
       "         b'Seductive aromas of raspberries, sandalwood, graphite and a pinch of allspice entertain the nose on this wine. The spiced wood character carries to the palate, where dried strawberries and pomegranate add riper fruit elements.',\n",
       "         b'This fresh, appealing wine is lightly spritzy, with flavors of pear and melon that show persistence.',\n",
       "         b\"Yellow fruits lead off this sophisticated wine. With its creamy texture, overlaid by a more steely texture, it's a wine that has aging potential as well as present fruitiness for early drinking. So age for four years or give in to the freshness now. Screwcap.\",\n",
       "         b\"If you open this bottle before late 2009, you'll find a tightly wound wine marked by acidity and tannins. In other words, not showing its best. Inside the structure is remarkably ripe fruit, along the lines of cherries, currants, pomegranates and cola. It's a big, exuberant wine, but it does need time, and has the balance to achieve it.\",\n",
       "         b\"Treana has enjoyed great success with this blend of Viognier and Marsanne, which is one of the best Rh\\xc3\\xb4ne-style white wines in California. The main reason is the source of the grapes. The vineyard, owned by the Wagners of Caymus, is stellar. The '06 is as rich and crisply acidic as ever, with fantastically complex, honeyed tropical fruit, apricot and floral flavors that taste like they have a touch of botrytis.\",\n",
       "         b\"There's brilliant black cherry and blackberry richness on the nose of this blend of 10 grapes, from Syrah to Malbec to Touriga Nacional, as well as a mineral character of cold asphalt, clay and mud. The palate offers earthy and delicious flavors, with dried strawberry and olallieberry as well as black pepper and cappuccino.\",\n",
       "         b\"Having spent only 12 months in barrel, this vintage of the producer's Claret is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon with 34% Merlot, 4% Malbec, 3% Syrah, 2% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. It opens in exotic floral and spice, with a juicy midpalate around soft, rounded tannins and smoothly integrated oak. It provides extraordinary value for the quality.\",\n",
       "         b'Black cherry fruit is followed by notes of espresso, leather, crushed granite, cola and licorice. The wine shows bright acidity in the mouth but it also has enough fruity pulp and density to soften that sharpness. Pair this wine with spicy baby-back ribs.',\n",
       "         b\"Spicy, herbaceous aromas, fresh flavors and a nicely crisp and lightly tannic texture make this medium-bodied wine versatile. It's light enough to drink at lunch or before dinner and it's well-balanced enough to go with lots of different kinds of food. Its name is a nod to super Tuscan wines, since this blend contains Montepulciano and Sangiovese grapes, among others.\",\n",
       "         b'Made to be drunk young, this wine gives a burst of ripe red fruit. The tannins are soft and open, balanced with acidity. The aftertaste is smooth and generous. Drink now.',\n",
       "         b'In this solidly made wine, the varietal character shines through, with cranberry and cherry fruit precisely defined. It offers medium depth and good balance, with a light lick of chocolate in the finish.',\n",
       "         b'A densely structured, very mineral-textured wine, this has spice and acidity as well as dark tannins. Black currants lend a juicy acidity that cuts right through the finish. Screwcap.',\n",
       "         b'This beautifully perfumed wine comes from one of the highest in elevation premier cru vineyards. The tannins have fully integrated with the red berry and cherry fruits to give a soft, jammy character that contrasts with acidity to give a great lift at the end. Drink this sophisticated wine from 2018.',\n",
       "         b'Red berry, baking spice and grilled herb aromas lead the nose. The taut palate doles out succulent black cherry, raspberry, licorice and a mint note alongside firm but polished tannins. Give this time to open up and unwind. Drink 2017\\xe2\\x80\\x932024.',\n",
       "         b'Deep purple in color, and soupy on the nose, with a strong hint of lemon. The palate is almost astringent due to elevated acidity, thus the balance of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bonarda blend is sketchy. Tastes more like grape juice than fine wine, with a hollow, tangy finish.',\n",
       "         b'An impressive, powerful pepper- and yellow fruit-flavored wine, which has been given a considerable depth of flavor by the wood fermentation and lees aging. The balance is great. It is a wine that shows class and aging potential.',\n",
       "         b'A full, structured wine, showing attractive damson and blackberry flavors along with a strong element of wood aging. The wine is rich, its juicy Merlot character joined with final acidity.',\n",
       "         b'Rich and soft, this has a creamy smooth texture, with notes of toast, ripe apple and quince. There is a good touch of acidity to this attractive, ready to drink wine.',\n",
       "         b\"Stemmy in earthy pine and clove-like spice, this is a powerfully dense and delicious wine. It's on the higher side in terms of alcohol, though doesn't reflect it in bouquet or taste. Savory dark berry wraps itself around mushroomy truffles and black tea to linger on the tongue through a lengthy, weighty finish.\",\n",
       "         b\"Gritty white-fruit aromas show a note of vanilla. This tastes of bland passion fruit, with a weedy note thrown in. On the finish, this doesn't give much at all.\",\n",
       "         b\"This wine has an initial strong tannic element that submerges the red fruits. As it opens, the wine reveals more juiciness, berry flavors and fresh acidity. It's still young and needs to be aged. Drink from 2018.\",\n",
       "         b'The Alatus blend is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Malbec and Syrah also in the mix. Dark and spicy, it remains compact and toasty, with a solid core of cassis, coffee grounds, cedar and smoke. The barrel influences (40% new) are well displayed, but the rest of the wine needs more time to catch up.',\n",
       "         b\"Too sharp in texture, with a cut of acidity that emphasizes the white pepper, and seems to bring out some greenness. Other than that, you'll find a smoothly tannic wine, with blackberry and currant fruit.\",\n",
       "         b\"This Merlot smells rooty, with licorice and mint to boot. A wide, sort of flabby palate is, at its base, oaky as can be; there's also stewed plum and herbal blackberry flavors in front of a blocky, chunky finish.\",\n",
       "         b'What sets this wine apart are the cooling aromas of chopped mint and white licorice. It delivers tangy layers of black olive, resin, tar, tobacco leaf and sweet cinnamon stick.',\n",
       "         b'Veins of sweet cinnamon and chocolate run through the body of this thick, concentrated wine. Exceedingly soft and supple, it has penetrating endnotes of cherry preserves, blackberry pie and Middle Eastern spice.',\n",
       "         b'Bright and light, this offers yellow fruits that are cut with citrus to give a clean character as well as richness. Drink now for its crisp aftertaste and warm texture.',\n",
       "         b\"Milk chocolate, toast and raspberry aromas are followed by quite sweet fruit flavors. It's unabashed in its easy-drinking appeal.\",\n",
       "         b'For Central Otago Chardonnay, this is rather rich and chunky on the palate, delivering hints of grilled sweet corn and ripe melon. It falls off a bit on the finish, so drink up over the next several months.',\n",
       "         b'The tannins of the vintage are very apparent in this dry wine. That gives it a dry structure that was enhanced by wood aging. It needs to develop longer and become a wine that is balanced while always austere. Drink from 2017.',\n",
       "         b'Creamy, rich and loaded with apricot and peach, this would pair well with creamy vegetable risotto.',\n",
       "         b'Dark purple in color, the nose is oak-laden, with toasted vanilla, sawdust and coconut pervading. Medium to full bodied, the palate is dark and brooding featuring rich black fruit, extracted tannins and a cocoa-dusted finish.',\n",
       "         b\"A traditional and relatively light garnet color is the first sign that this is not a blatantly commercial wine. Savory, almost meaty, and cranberry-like aromas confirm the impression. Take a good sip and more crisp fruits like raspberries and red cherries emerge along with hints of cinnamon and clove for complexity. While medium bodied, it's vibrant in texture and elegantly balanced. It should improve through 2022.\",\n",
       "         b'Made entirely with rare native grape Uvalino, this opens with aromas that recall ripe black plum and vanilla. The dense robust palate delivers prune, clove and a dusting of cocoa alongside assertive tannins. Enjoy through 2018.',\n",
       "         b'Tribute is 41% Syrah, 30% Merlot and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon, all estate-grown. The bouquet opens immediately into a fascinating complexity. What wafts up from the glass is a heady mix of incense, smoke, jam, toast, iron and herb\\xe2\\x80\\x94you can spend a pleasant 10 or 15 minutes just counting all the threads. Spicy, loaded with raspberry and strawberry fruit, gentle acids and silky tannins, this glides comfortably into a tangy finish.',\n",
       "         b\"This is a huge, extracted Cabernet Sauvignon. It's just what people expect Napa Cabernet to be: ripe, heady, oaky and bold. With deep, classy cassis, plum and chocolate flavors, it should develop additional nuances after 2017.\",\n",
       "         b'This soft wine has ripe melon and pear flavors only lightly cut with citrus acidity. It is easy to drink and ready now.',\n",
       "         b\"This delivers a solid mix of red fruits, herbs and spices on the nose. The palate feels a little jagged, but it's forward and contains lively flavors of cherry, plum, nutmeg and brown sugar. It's fruity on the finish, with a dash of cocoa.\"],\n",
